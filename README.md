# Chimera (Coding Challenges)

`“The Chimera was a fearsome creature, a combination of the most powerful and dangerous animals on earth. It was said to be the size of a mountain, with the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tail of a serpent. It could breathe fire, and its roar was said to be so loud that it could shake the ground.”` 
<br>– Hesiod, Theogony

Welcome to my coding challenges repository! Here, you'll find a collection of coding challenges that I have completed in various programming languages. These challenges serve as a demonstration of my problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and proficiency in different programming languages.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to log my challenges in various coding languages, what I learned, potentially what others have done, and my growth overtime. In these challenges I work with various data structures, algorithms, and logical problems.

### Folder Structure
The repository is organized into folders based on programming languages. Each folder contains subfolders or files representing individual coding challenges. Here's an overview of the folder structure:


```
|- README.md         
|- Python/           
|  |- Challenge1.py  
|  |- Challenge2.py  
|  |- ...
|- Ruby/             
|  |- Challenge1.rb
|  |- Challenge2.rb
|  |- ...
|- JavaScript/       
|  |- Challenge1.js  
|  |- Challenge2.js  
|  |- ...
|- ...
```

## How to Use
You can explore each programming language folder to view the challenges and their corresponding solutions. Feel free to browse through the code, review my approach to solving each challenge, and assess my coding style and practices.

## Languages and Tools
I have completed challenges in various programming languages, including but not limited to:
