"""
Your task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

Examples:
Input: 42145 Output: 54421
Input: 145263 Output: 654321
Input: 123456789 Output: 987654321

# Initial Thoughts:


def descending_order(num):
    return


num = 42145
print(descending_order(num))
# Answer should be: 54421

num = 145263
print(descending_order(num))
# Answer should be: 654321

num = 123456789
print(descending_order(num))
# Answer should be: 987654321
